## Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation

This project uses a U-Net-based deep learning model for segmenting brain tumors from MRI images. The model has been trained on the [LGG Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation) and performs binary segmentation to identify tumor regions in MRI scans.

---

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: A U-Net architecture for accurate tumor segmentation.
- **Preprocessing**: Normalizes and resizes MRI images to match the model input.
- **Metrics**: Includes Dice Coefficients and Intersection Over Union (IoU) for evaluation.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web app (built with Python and Django) allows users to upload MRI scans and get predictions. *(Link to be added soon.)*
